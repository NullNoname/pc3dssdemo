# PaulsCode 3D Sound System Unofficial Android Branch Demo
This is an example application of [Paul Lamb's 3D Sound System](http://www.paulscode.com/forum/index.php?topic=4.0), using my [unofficial Android port](https://github.com/NullNoname/Paulscode-SoundSystem/tree/droid) with [LibraryAudioTrack](https://github.com/NullNoname/paudiotrack) library.

It can be built using Eclipse (yes I'm still using it) or from Gradle.
